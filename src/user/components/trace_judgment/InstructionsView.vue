  (participants are told one step is skipped; the bonus is stated in one line; the
  "Disagree when their mistake is a different one..." sentence removed).
  The numbers here mirror the task code: $2 = MAX_BONUS and 3 seconds =
  UNLOCK_DELAY_MS in TraceJudgmentView.vue, 24 problems = the form size in
  utils/sampleForm.js, 3 practice questions = data/practice_items.json. Change
  them together.

        In this study you will see a math problem, the step-by-step work a student wrote while solving it with
        <strong>one step skipped</strong>, and a statement about what that student believes about the order of
        operations.
      </p>

      <p class="text-left text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>The correct order of operations:</strong> brackets first; then × and ÷, working left to right; then +
        and -, working left to right.
      </p>

      <p class="text-left text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Every student in this study makes exactly one mistake</strong>, at one step of their work.
      </p>

      <p class="text-left text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Your job.</strong> Rate how much you agree that the statement describes what the student believes,
        using their work as evidence. Agree when the student's mistake is the one the statement describes. Use the
        6-point scale, from <strong>Strongly Disagree</strong> to <strong>Strongly Agree</strong>, to show how sure you
        are.
      </p>

      <p class="text-left text-lg mb-4"><strong>Bonus.</strong> You can earn a bonus of up to $2.</p>

      <p class="text-left text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>What happens next.</strong> You'll start with <strong>3 practice questions</strong>. After each one,
        we highlight the student's mistake and explain the right answer. Practice doesn't count toward your bonus.
        Then you'll judge <strong>24 problems</strong>. On each one, the answer buttons unlock after 3 seconds, so
        take time to read the work.
